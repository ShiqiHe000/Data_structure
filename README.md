# Data Structure Algorithm Practise

## Practise Cases

**1 Postfix expression**: evaluate postfix expression. 

**2 Transfer infix expresstion to postfix expression**: Transfer a string of infix expression into a postfix one. 

**3 Implement queue date structure by using an array**: Implement queue data structure by using array data structure and performs enqueue, dequeue, check empty/full, return front/rear operattions. 

**4 Implement queue by using an linked list**: Implement a queque data structure and performs 
						its operation in constant time by using a linked list .

**5 Implement a binary tree** : Implement a binary tree and performs search and insert operations by using recursion funciton. 

**6 Find the minimum value in the binary tree**: Search for the minimum value in the binary tree. Using recursive method and iterative method.  

**7 Find the height of a node inside a binary tree**: Find the height of a node inside a binary tree. Using recursive algorithm. 


**8 Traverse the binary tree in level-order**: Visit all the nodes at the same level before we move to the next level.
